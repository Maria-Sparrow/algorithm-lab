1. clone my repository: 
(if you are working with a console)
```
https://github.com/Maria-Sparrow/algorithm-lab.git
```
* or download and extract it;

2. open command prompt and switch the directory to **/algorithm-lab**:
```
cd algorithm-lab
```
* if you decided to download and extract it to, let us say, D:/projects, you would do it like that:
```
D:
```
```
cd projects/algorithm-lab
```


3. if you do not have Phyton 3+ installed, you must use the console:
```
python main.py
```

***

this program shows you the results of insertion and merge sorts for each algorithm, it also shows some additional information, such as:
* time,
* swap counter,
* comparison counter.

counters represent the numbers of corresponding operations that occurred during the sorting process.

the list of objects is taken from *basin.csv* file. Each row there represents a new object as a sequence of its properties' values separated by commas. The order is:
```
address, volume_of_water, max_number_of_visitors
```
